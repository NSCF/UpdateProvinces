# this is the main script file that will do all the work
# lets start by adding the processing steps here, as comments. We will then fill in the code

#extract records form BODATSA into csv file


#open/read records csv file

#open/read provinces csv file


#loop through botanical records in csv


#check each record's qds against QDSProvinces.csv
    #if qds in one province only - update record's qds according to QDSProvinces.csv
    #if qds in 2 or more provinces - use locality notes to update province...



#change province abbreviation to values in BODATSA dropdown list


#write unique identifier and updated provinces to new csv file


#push updates back into BODATSA
