## Script for updating old province names to new names

This is primarily an exercise in practicing scripting skills to build a useful tool for a small data management task. In this case the task is to update old South African province names to new names for a collection database. 

We will build and improve the code as a group until we have something that everyone is happy to work with. 

All discussion about this work will happen through the data-management-training Slack channel.

Good luck!!
